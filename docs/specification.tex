\section*{KnitPick\#++ Specification}

Locke Meyer, Felix King

\subsection{Introduction}

\indent
KnitPick\#++ turns the tedious process of creating a knitting pattern, a set of instructions that 
describe the construction process of a specific garment, into a precise, painless, and intuitive programming experience. 
Ordinarily, creating a knitting pattern requires both some math skills as well as the graphic design savvy to organise the 
document clearly; with KnitPick\#++, these are no longer required. Furthermore, the various styles of knitting pattern that 
exist can be confusing to a knitter without a wide range of prior knitting experience; KnitPick\#++ establishes a powerful 
and expressive standard for knitting patterns that can be easily learned and read by anyone.

\bigskip

Many knitting patterns rely not only on repetition of single stitches, but also entire rows of stitches and of sets of rows. 
Also, since a secondary goal of knitting patterns is for a given pattern to produce the exact same garment every time, the output 
is deterministic. For these reasons, the problem of generating knitting patterns is particularly suited to a programming language-based 
solution, since programming languages offer easy repetition of pieces of information as well as precision.

\subsection{Design Principles}

One of our technical goals for KnitPick\#++ is for it to be relatively lightweight in terms of (e.g.) 
the number of basic stitches that are defined by the language. However, we also want to design KnitPick\#++ 
such that users can define new stitch types (and other variables) to fit their needs – for instance, by 
defining a less common stitch that serves a more niche purpose in the knitting process. Another one of our 
goals for KnitPick\#++ is to have it generate documents that look nice and are easy to comprehend. An aesthetic goal 
is for KnitPick\#++ code to be concise and readable; for this reason, many keywords in our syntax are abbreviations.

\subsection{Examples}

Each of the following examples will be executed by running the command-line argument "dotnet run example-1.kpp example-1",
and then "pdflatex example-1.tex". Sample outputs can be found in the "examples" folder in the docs directory.

\subsection{Language Concepts}

The user will be thinking in terms of \textbf{paragraphs} consisting of text instructions. Each paragraph of text
will correspond to a part of the garment -- for instance, the ribbing of a scarf or the cuff of a sweater. 
Furthermore, each paragraph of text is made up of \textbf{instructions}, and these instructions are themselves made up 
of \textbf{sequences} including \textbf{stitches}, numbers, or other more specialized directives. For example, one paragraph of a sock 
knitting pattern might look like this.

\begin{verbatim}
Cuff:  
cast on 64

Row 1: knit 2 purl 2 to end of row.
Repeat Row 1 for 16 total rows.
\end{verbatim}

The primitives of this language are integers, floats, and strings. These primitives will all combine in various ways to create 
the paragraphs of text instructions in the final pattern. Integers are used to represent the number of repetitions of a stitch and
the number of times to repeat an instruction, among other things. Strings represent the names of stitches and any custom
instruction the user wants to include. Floats appear in the header of a document and provide precise information about the "gauge" of the 
pattern and the size of the yarn to be used.

\subsection{Formal Syntax}

Each program begins with the statement “new pattern” followed by a string, and then an integer. This string defines the name 
of the knitting pattern, and the integer defines the number of stitches to be casted on for this pattern. Underneath the 
“new pattern” statement, the user must define three fields – needles, yarn, and gauge, in that order – by typing the name of 
the field followed by ‘=’. The needles field defines the type of knitting needles to be used and their sizes, the yarn field 
defines the type of yarn to be used and its size, and the gauge defines the number of stitches per inch of fabric. All of the 
above constitutes the header of the program.

\bigskip

Once the header has been completed, the user will leave one line of whitespace and begin typing the body of the program. The 
body consists of paragraphs and grids. Most of the time, it will be convenient to create a variable for a paragraph or grid above 
the header.

\bigskip

A paragraph is defined by “pg” followed by a string, followed by a ‘=’. This string is the name of the paragraph. Underneath 
the “pg” statement, the user will define a string, a row, a repeat statement, a taper statement, or some combination of these. 
A row is defined by “row” followed by a string, followed by a ‘=’, followed by a sequence of stitches. A repeat is defined by 
“repeat” followed by an integer, followed by one or more rows. Here, the integer defines the number of times to repeat the rows 
in the statement. A taper is defined by “taper”, followed by a char, followed by an integer, followed by a ->, followed by 
another integer, followed by one or more rows. Here, the integers around the arrow define the starting and ending ‘widths’ of 
the taper pattern; this instruction is useful for creating rounded portions of garments (like the top of a beanie).

\bigskip

\textbf{Minimal Formal Grammar}

For now, the start expression is paragraph.
\begin{verbatim}
    <paragraph>   ::= "pg "<string>((<ws>)*<instruction>(<ws>)*)+
    <instruction> ::= <string>
                  |   <row>
    <row>         ::= (<stitchSeq>(<ws>)*)+
    <stitchSeq>   ::= <stitch><number>
                  |   <plus><stitchSeq>
                  |   <oParen><stitchSeq><stitchSeq><cParen>
    <stitch>      ::= 'k'
                  |   'p'
    <number>      ::= <d><number>
                  |   <d>
    <d>           ::= '0' | '1' | ... | '8' | '9'
    <plus>        ::= '+'
    <oParen>      ::= '('
    <cParen>      ::= ')'
    <string>      ::= <quote>(<character)+<quote>
    <ws>          ::= ' ' | '\n' | '\t' | "\rn"
    <quote>       ::= '"'
    <character>   ::= ' ' | '!' | ... | '}' | '~'
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Remaining Work}

We are still planning on implementing a couple of other possibilities for the Instruction type -- Taper and Repeat. These cases
will allow for easy inclusion of common knitting instructions describing how to create a taper (e.g. the top of a hat) or several 
repeated rows. After this, we will create the Document type, which is made up of a Header and multiple Paragraphs; we will also need 
to implement the Header type, which contains information about the types and sizes of yarn to be used for the garment. If we have time 
remaining after doing this work, we will implement variables so that it's easy to repeat Paragraphs in a Document.
