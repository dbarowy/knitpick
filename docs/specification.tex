\section*{KnitPick\#++ Specification}

Locke Meyer, Felix King

\subsection{Introduction}

\indent
KnitPick\#++ turns the tedious process of creating a knitting pattern, a set of instructions that 
describe the construction process of a specific garment, into a precise, painless, and intuitive programming experience. 
Ordinarily, creating a knitting pattern requires the graphic design savvy to organise the 
document cleanly and clearly; with KnitPick\#++, this are no longer required. Furthermore, the various styles of knitting pattern that 
exist can be confusing to a knitter without a wide range of prior knitting experience; KnitPick\#++ establishes a powerful 
and expressive standard for knitting patterns that can be easily learned and read by anyone.

\bigskip

Many knitting patterns rely not only on repetition of single stitches, but also entire rows of stitches and of sets of rows. 
Also, since a secondary goal of knitting patterns is for a given pattern to produce the exact same garment every time, the output 
is deterministic. For these reasons, the problem of generating knitting patterns is particularly suited to a programming language-based 
solution, since programming languages offer easy repetition of pieces of information as well as precision.

\subsection{Design Principles}

One of our technical goals for KnitPick\#++ is for it to be relatively lightweight in terms of (e.g.) 
the number of basic stitches that are defined by the language. However, we also want to design KnitPick\#++ 
such that users can define new stitch types to fit their needs â€“ for instance, by 
defining a less common stitch that serves a more niche purpose in the knitting process, like the moss stitch. Another one of our 
goals for KnitPick\#++ is to have it generate documents that look nice and are easy to comprehend. An aesthetic goal 
is for KnitPick\#++ code to be concise and readable; for this reason, many keywords in our syntax are abbreviations.

\subsection{Examples}

NOTE: To run the examples, you must be using a machine with LaTeX installed. To be safe (if you want to 
ensure that all necessary packages are present), you can ssh into lohani (which was the environment that
we built KnitPick\#++ in) and clone into a directory on there.

\smallskip

Each of the following examples can be executed from within the examples folder 
by typing the following into the terminal: 
"dotnet run --project ../../code/kpplibrary example-1.kpp example-1". Here, "example-1.kpp" is the name of the file containing KnitPick\#++ code 
and "example-1" is the name of the pdf file that will be generated. 

KnitPick\#++ will automatically create a pdf of your knitting pattern.

\textbf{A.}

    repeat +k1, 35;

    repeat +(k4p4), 4;
    repeat +(p4k4), 4;
    "continue in this manner until garment measures 8.5 inches";

pg "Taper"
    repeat +k1, +(k7tog1), 10;

pg "End"
    "Cut yarn to about 1 foot long";
    "Using an embroidery needle, thread together last stitches and tie a knot";
    "Sew in the ends";
\end{verbatim}
\newpage

\subsection{Language Concepts}

The user will be thinking in terms of \textbf{paragraphs} consisting of text instructions. Each paragraph of text
will correspond to a part of the garment -- for instance, the ribbing of a scarf or the cuff of a sweater. 
Furthermore, each paragraph of text is made up of \textbf{instructions}, and these instructions are themselves made up 
of \textbf{sequences} including \textbf{stitches}, numbers, or other more specialized directives. For example, one paragraph of a sock 
knitting pattern might look like this.

\begin{verbatim}
Cuff
Step 1. cast on 64.
Step 2. 
    (a) knit 2, purl 2 to end of row.
Repeat for a total of 16 times.
\end{verbatim}

The primitives of this language are integers, floats, and strings. These primitives will all combine in various ways to create 
the paragraphs of text instructions in the final pattern. Integers are used to represent the number of repetitions of a stitch and
the number of times to repeat an instruction, among other things. Strings represent the names of stitches and any custom
instruction the user wants to include. Floats appear in the header of a document and provide precise information about the "gauge" of the 
pattern and the size of the yarn to be used.

\subsection{Remaining Work}

In our previous draft, we had mentioned wanting to implement a Taper type -- this actually turned out to be redundant due to the Repeat type. 
We also mentioned that we wanted to implement variables. And we did! HOWEVER, due to the design of our whole abstract syntax tree, we realized that we wouldn't be able to implement a variable that could represent
any arbitrary data type. This was a valuable learning experience! We did end up implementing variables anyway; it's just that they
can only represent stitches. 

In the future, it would be nice to add a way for the user to create a colored grid pattern as a visual aid to the knitting instructions. 
This was something we had originally thought about doing. However, we realized early on in the process of designing KnitPick\#++ 
that we just wouldn't end up having time to implement it, but it could be cool to come to and work on at some point.
